# EcoMind AI 🌳  
*A community-powered plant tracker to inspire climate action*  

## 🚀 About
EcoMind AI is a simple but powerful app that lets users log plants they’ve spotted or planted.  
You can add:
- 🌱 Plant name  
- 📍 Location  
- 📝 Notes  
- 📸 Photos  

All posts appear in a **community feed**, creating a shared green diary of local biodiversity.  

## ✨ Features
- Easy plant logging with name, location, and notes  
- Upload plant photos  
- Posts saved in a community feed (`posts.txt`)  
- Local + photo saving support  

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Enter plant details in the form.  
2. Optionally upload a plant photo.  
3. Submit, and your post will be saved + displayed in the feed.  

## 💡 Why EcoMind?
EcoMind is built for climate awareness.  
Instead of just *talking* about sustainability, EcoMind helps communities take small but meaningful steps — noticing, recording, and appreciating green life around them.
